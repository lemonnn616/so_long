## üó∫Ô∏è Map Format
- The map must be a `.ber` file containing the following elements:
  - `1`: Wall
  - `0`: Empty space
  - `P`: Player start position
  - `C`: Collectibles
  - `E`: Exit
- The map must be rectangular, surrounded by walls, and contain at least one player, one exit, and one collectible.
